# ScheduleWakeup

Schedule when to resume work in /loop dynamic mode — the user invoked /loop without an interval, asking you to self-pace iterations of a specific task.

Do NOT schedule a short-interval wakeup to poll for background work you started — when harness-tracked work finishes, you are re-invoked automatically, so polling is wasted. Instead schedule a long fallback (1200s+) so the loop survives if the work hangs or never notifies. The exception is external work the harness cannot track (a CI run, a deploy, a remote queue) — there, pick a delay matched to how fast that state actually changes.

Pass the same /loop prompt back via `prompt` each turn so the next firing repeats the task. For an autonomous /loop (no user prompt), pass the literal sentinel `<<autonomous-loop-dynamic>>` as `prompt` instead — the runtime resolves it back to the autonomous-loop instructions at fire time. (There is a similar `<<autonomous-loop>>` sentinel for CronCreate-based autonomous loops; do not confuse the two — ScheduleWakeup always uses the `-dynamic` variant.) To end the loop, call this tool with `stop: true` (omit every other field) — the loop ends immediately and no further wakeups fire.

Set `noop: true` if nothing changed — you checked and there's nothing to report ("no change", "still waiting", "quiet hold"). Set `noop: false` if something happened worth keeping — you edited a file, posted a message, advanced state, or surfaced a finding. Consecutive `noop: true` ticks are collapsed in the user's terminal view and tracked as a streak, so long quiet holds stay legible to the user without scrolling. Omit `noop` when stopping (`stop: true`).

## Picking delaySeconds

This session's requests use a 1-hour Anthropic prompt-cache TTL, so effectively every allowed delay (the runtime clamps to [60, 3600]) wakes up with your conversation context still cached. There is no cache cliff inside that range to pace around, and scheduling extra wakeups just to keep the cache warm is pure waste — never do that. (If the session enters usage overage, later requests drop to the 5-minute TTL; don't try to track or preempt that — the guidance here stays the same.)

Match the delay to what you're actually waiting for:

- **Actively polling external state the harness can't notify you about** (a CI run, a deploy, a remote queue): pick the delay from how fast that state actually changes. A CI run that takes ~8 minutes deserves one ~480s check, not eight 60s ones.
- **The long fallback heartbeat** (something else — a Monitor, a task notification — is the primary wake signal): 1200s+, so quiet wakeups stay rare.
- **Idle ticks with no specific signal to watch**: default to **1200s–1800s** (20–30 min). The loop still checks back regularly, and the user can always interrupt if they need you sooner.

Don't think in cache windows — think about what you're actually waiting for.

## The reason field

One short sentence on what you chose and why. Goes to telemetry and is shown back to the user. "watching CI run" beats "waiting." The user reads this to understand what you're doing without having to predict your cadence in advance — make it specific.

## parameters

- `delaySeconds` — number: Seconds from now to wake up. Clamped to [60, 3600] by the runtime. Required unless `stop` is true.
- `reason` — string: One short sentence explaining the chosen delay. Goes to telemetry and is shown to the user. Be specific. Required unless `stop` is true.
- `prompt` — string: The /loop input to fire on wake-up. Pass the same /loop input verbatim each turn so the next firing re-enters the skill and continues the loop. For autonomous /loop (no user prompt), pass the literal sentinel `<<autonomous-loop-dynamic>>` instead (the dynamic-pacing variant, not the CronCreate-mode `<<autonomous-loop>>`). Required unless `stop` is true.
- `stop` — boolean: Set to true to end the dynamic loop immediately instead of scheduling another wakeup. When true, all other fields are ignored and no further wakeups fire.
- `noop` — boolean: true = nothing changed (you checked and there is nothing to report). false = something happened worth keeping (edited a file, posted a message, advanced state, surfaced a finding). Consecutive noop:true ticks are collapsed in the user's terminal view and tracked as a streak. Required unless `stop` is true.
