# ListAgents

Lists agents you can SendMessage to — in-process subagents you spawned, the teammates on your team, other local Claude sessions on this machine, your Claude sessions running in the cloud (when this session has cloud access; a cloud session receives your message but cannot message any session back yet — do not ask it to reply, read its answer in its own transcript), and (when Remote Control is connected here) your account's other sessions — Remote Control sessions on other machines and cloud sessions, each row labeled by kind. Names are the address: send with `SendMessage({to: "<name>", message: "..."})`, copying the name exactly as a row prints it. Append a row's ` [ref]` only when the bare name is not enough — two rows share it, or an error asks you to disambiguate.

## parameters

- `channel` — string: Not available in this build; leave unset.
- `q` — string: Not available in this build; leave unset.
