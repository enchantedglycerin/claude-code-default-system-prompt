# NotebookEdit

Replaces, inserts, or deletes a single cell in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file).

Usage:
- You must use the Read tool on the notebook in this conversation before editing — this tool will fail otherwise.
- `notebook_path` must be an absolute path.
- `cell_id` is the `id` attribute shown in the Read tool's `<cell id="...">` output. It is required for `replace` and `delete`.
- `edit_mode` defaults to `replace`. Use `insert` to add a new cell after the cell with the given `cell_id` (or at the beginning of the notebook if `cell_id` is omitted) — `cell_type` is required when inserting. Use `delete` to remove the cell.

## parameters

- `notebook_path` **(required)** — string: The absolute path to the Jupyter notebook file to edit (must be absolute, not relative)
- `cell_id` — string: The ID of the cell to edit. When inserting a new cell, the new cell will be inserted after the cell with this ID, or at the beginning if not specified.
- `new_source` **(required)** — string: The new source for the cell
- `cell_type` — string: The type of the cell (code or markdown). If not specified, it defaults to the current cell type. If using edit_mode=insert, this is required.
- `edit_mode` — string: The type of edit to make (replace, insert, delete). Defaults to replace.
